Thalodomos, Thalodomos, it is your father, Neptune!
You are in grave danger son! I have made a mistake.
I have been arguing with Minerva over who the city of Attica will be named after.
Things have gotten..a little out of line, son.
Minerva learned where you, my son, live.
I overheard her talking to Pluto on Olympus!
She's sent the Furies after you, you need to get away!
Run through the woods and look for my aid near the water.
However, you will only really be safe once you reach the ocean.
Good luck, my son!

Beware, boy, we are the sisters of death!
You cannot escape your fate!

Thalodomos reached the top of the ledge.
Knowing he must escape the Furies, he jumped into the sea.
Neptune allowed Athens to be Minerva's, and his son was safe.
Thalodomos lived a happy life for many years afterwards.
When he died of old age, a mysterious fisherman painted a mysterious mosaic in his tomb.
To this day, archaeologists are baffled by what it could depict.
