Thalodomos, Thalodomos, it is your father, Neptune!
You are in grave danger son! I have made a mistake.
I have been arguing with Minerva over something.
She wants to steal the name to my city in Attica.
Things have gotten..a little out of line, son.
Minerva learned where you live and..you know how gods are..
I overheard her talking to Pluto on Olympus!
She's sent the Furies after you, you need to get away!
Run through the woods and look for my aid near the water.
However, you will only really be safe once you reach the ocean.
Good luck, my son!

Beware, boy, we are the sisters of death!
You cannot escape your fate!

Use this to kill the Furies!
Make sure you pick it up again afterwards!
Excellent, you've found another trident!

Thalodomos approached the top of the ledge...
Knowing he must escape the Furies, he jumped into the sea.
Luckily, his father allowed him to land safely below.
Neptune allowed Athens to be Minerva's, and the Furies left.
Thalodomos lived a happy life for many years afterwards.
When he died, a mysterious fisherman was seen in his tomb.
Thalodomos's family later noticed a new fresco inside.
To this day, archaeologists are baffled by what it could depict.

Let us say nothing but good about the dead!
